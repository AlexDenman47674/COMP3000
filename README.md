# COMP3000

This repository holds the code used to create the Systematic Operator for Facial Identification Assistance (SOFIA) application. This was designed to aid sufferers of prosopagnosia and similar disorders such as dementia by allowing for accurate facial identification. It features 8 forms including: a login/signup, main, facial recognition, database, user settings/password & about us.

Both the front and back end were made in Visual Studio 2019 in C# and committed to this repository via GitHub Desktop
